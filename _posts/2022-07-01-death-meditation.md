TL;DR: Your life is finite and thus your action brings meaning to life. Your biochemistry will distract you from this mission. To be human is to be aware of these and act accordingly.

## **The cosmic perspective** 

In the vast universe that is 14 billion years old, a tiny clump of matter, for complex reasons beyond comprehension, comes together and is endowed with the gift of consciousness.

That is me. I am the clump of matter.

I am here only temporarily. Before I quickly dissolve back into nothingness.

Then after that there will be an eternity without me.


## **The human vantage points**

Looking at a child’s birth and onwards, life inevitably seems to be a progression towards death.

But looking at the infinity before and after life. Life is a precious tiny sparkle, within which I am gifted with the ability to do something and feel something, instead of nothing.

That’s why parents think their children should be thankful to be born, and children sometimes resent their parents for giving them life, because each is standing on their own vantage point.


## **The countdown to death**

Everyday I wake up, death is yet another day closer. 

There might be at most 80 functional years in my life. If one day is counted in one second, there is around 8 hours of countdown to death.

Considering I can't even remember what happened last Thursday, such countdown seems to be almost in real-time!

And death is coming … no matter what. 


## **The awareness of death animated life**

But, thanks to death, life is worth acting on.

There is now a sense of Finality, and Finality begs the question - what should I do with my life? Because beyond death, the question is stale forever.

There is no particular “something to do” though. There is no recipe, no instructions written anywhere. 

Religious texts written a few thousand years ago aimed to bring structure to human’s agricultural life, are now fading into irrelevance. The more humankind understands their universe, the less structure and constraints they find there is to their own lives.

And so the countdown to death is imbued with a challenge: to make *your own* sparkle of life worth its while. To be human is to be challenged by this.


## **Distractions from the awareness of death**

The 8 hours countdown took quite a bit of time to warm up and cool down as well. To realize the truth written in this essay, it took me 25 years. So that’s 2.5 hours gone.

The remaining time is also subjected to multiple time sinks I cannot escape.

Sleep took away one third of my time, then there is disease and illness, time to commute, time to fall in and out of love. 

The remaining part is plagued with subconscious biological urges that constantly suck away time, distracting me from the reality of an inevitable death. 

The modern world is full of such distractions. Today, social media is the number one culprit, taking advantage of my biochemistry and poisoned my thoughts to that of a drunk and addicted human. 

I have now lost count of the many long streaks of dopamine binge that had unfortunately stole away months of my life. Years even? Those empty days are forever gone.


## **Human and animals**

Animals are dictated by their biochemistry too. Hormonal bursts are what drive them. There is no plan nor urgency in their action. Their whole life is a distraction from death.

Many humans ended up no more than mere animals their entire life. Most humans become more humanly as they get older, as death becomes noticably tangible. Yet ironically it is around this time that so much time has been wasted, and regrets set in.

The tiny sparkle of life runs out quick. And people, including myself, are constantly distracted from this fundamental awareness. To be human is to have a way out of such distraction.


## **Escaping the biochemistry traps**


There are occasional moments of clarity, where my human thoughts prevail, and the awareness of death gets a hold of my attention. Meditation prolonged this, and writing this thought down cements it further. 

In those moments of clarity, I also realize that escaping my biochemistry is impossible, while taming and wielding it to my own advantage is becoming easier. Years of neuro-biochemistry research yielded such possibilities. And to wield such knowledge is the power of human.


## **Meaning of life**

What is the meaning of life? There is none. We made it up and went with it. We have been doing so throughout the history of humankind, and will be doing so until our ascencion to the next plane of existence, if there is any.

Until then, I wish you and me both: the constant awareness of our death, a clarity of mind to reign and tame our animals within, and a meaningful life lived to our own accord.
