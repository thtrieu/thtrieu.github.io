title: (draft) A thought experiment on life, the universe, and everything.

One day you woke up to the ringing of your phone. 

Person on the other side told you your unniverse has just been created an hour ago.

Person is happy that her EM wave has finally tethered to your own universe.

WTF? Whatever. "Nô spéak Englịsh" you said and hang up.

Messages appeared on the phone.

Person told you your name, your age, your address.

Now you are fully awake and slightly panicked, what did you got yourself into? 

You've kept yourself reasonably clean and protected online.

You know phishing when you saw one. You're not your mom.

Those personal info is only known by your bank and employer.

Your bank account has been hacked? Why don't they just silently spend the money?

Right, they're stuck somewhere, social engineering is going on.

"scammer fuck off", you texted back while looking up the scam center contact.

Texts flooded in. You've never seen scammers going this far. *Move on to your next victim*, you think, *I'm broke, why so eager?*

In the text bubles, person told you your life story: 

Born and raised to a Vietnamese middle class family, in a peaceful coastal village, moved to a bigger city for college. 
Moved to the U.S. for work and then for study.

This is getting out of hand. Still, those are pretty generic and can possibly be guessed based on my legal name. 
But this is still hitting a bit too close to home. 

You almost stopped yourself scrolling to the next text bubbles:

Your parents name, your first home address, second one, then the third one. Your siblings, your partner.
What you did yesterday. The day before that. Number of eggs in your fridge (because you counted them). Then,

"I'm not a scammer. I'm your GOD. think."

You blocked the number. Run to the bathroom and washed your face. 
*I'm fully awake, this is not a dream.*

You carefully examine the details of your face. wrinkles and pores are in the right places. Detailed and fairly realistic.
2..3..5..7..11..13..17..19. *primes are complex enough to break a dream. But maybe I have internalized primes? Moving on.* 
The bug in your code is now freshly loaded in your mind and no, you still cannot solve it.

You're a nerd. You followed the protocol to verify a lucid dream. You've been prepared for this day alright.

*Who can this be? Not funny at all.* Their knowledge of you is just too intimate. 
You got a bad feeling in the back of your mind. Maybe this is it. The person is really *that* God?
*Ridiculous. A simpler explanation is always preferred.*

Another text chain.

"I thought you'll accept this easier given what you ranted online last week, 
"Sorry that I'm not very realistic in my expectations. Ask away."

Okay. *Someone read my blog post, and decided to unleash a prank on me*, you thought.
*Although that can be somewhat disappointing*. 
*No*, you corrected yourself, you would prefer this to be indeed a prank.
You pray for it to be one of your asshole friends. Or even a very skilled hacker.

"Okay I'll game. Tell me what I am thinking?"

"Don't know. Thoughts aren't recorded anywhere. Besides, we are in a real-time conversation now."

You snickered. *I thought you're god?* 

"But you know my fridge?"

"That's recorded in your house cam."

Okay, I see. the God here claimed to know all things everything recorded anywhere anytime?

"Then you're just a hacker."

"Functionally yes, still the best ever in all recorded history of mankind."

Okay. What would distinguish such God from a contemporary super hacker?
Obscure historical events first recorded by a camera?

"By the way that won't work"

"what?"

"Obscure events are things you can't verify yourself, so you will say I'm just making stuff up."

You panicked again. This person either read minds, or is extremely smart and have studied my way of thinking fairly extensively.
A stalker? Someone who find sadistic pleasure in toturing overthinking nerds like myself? 

"I thought you cannot read mind?" *why are you hiding your power ... god? I thought there is no malicious intent here*

"No, I cannot read minds still. Except we already did this last time. 
In the previous creation of your universe, you asked me exactly this."

Okay. You sunk to your sofa. This is getting very trippy. 

"Let that sink in, I'll go get a cup of coffee." - the next text bubble read.

*Thanks*. You thought but didn't reply. Things are getting convincing.
This can still be a person who is interested in your online post, 
at the same time also a super hacker of household cameras. And a stalker. And a pranker.
An owner of too much free time. A sadistic comedian. *My* type of comedy, but not one in which I'm a character.
Everytime you added on one such description, you know the explanation is getting more and more improbable.
How much time and efforts and planning for a person to pull off such pranks?

Still, what is the probability for the other explanation: such a god exist? 
It can be very small or very large. Maybe even 100%, you are a believer. You said it yourself online.

Still, you don't like the God explanation at this very moment, so you'll push the prankster's explanation.
The person still sound very confident. Their bag of tricks aren't running out?
This is an adversarial game overwhelmingly in my favor. Very improbable. What am I missing?

You turned off your house cams, opened your laptop and carefully re-read your blog post.
*Think* - you thought.
